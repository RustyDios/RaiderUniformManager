[h1] What is it? [/h1]
This manager lets you adjust cosmetic options for the raider factions
Made at the request of NelVlesis and with permission of Reality Machina, it uses similar code as MOCX but for 'any' raider faction.

[h1] How ? [/h1]
It is able to change the unit appearance post-spawn by template name for units on the Resistance or TeamOne or TeamTwo (where most Raider Factions appear).
This should help to optimize the spawns as it will skip over XCOM, ADVENT, CIVS and LOST

The adjusted template needs to use the 'soldier pawn' style of unit, so it cannot work on most aliens/enemies.

[h1] Config and Options [/h1]
You can [b]either[/b] set up units in the config file or design them in the character pool.
For the config option the mod has an example config provided by NelVlesis. 
The mod also has an example WSR config for changing the weapon appearances. 
You can use these configs by getting the mods listed in the config requirements and changing the filenames.

To use the 'from pool' options the character pool needs to have a unit with the nickname of the enemy Template eg [b]RhiSkirmSoldier_M1[/b]
I have extended the input of nicknames up to 30 characters in length to allow you to input the full template names.
The pool option will differentiate between Male and Female setups but [i]is ignored completely if a config option is found.[/i]
[b]The pool soldier needs to be ticked as 'DarkVIP'. [/b]

There is an example pool for the Phantoms included, to use this you need to move the file in the mods Pool folder files to;
[code]
(drive):\Users\A User\Documents\My Games\XCOM2 War of the Chosen\XComGame\CharacterPool\Importable
[/code]
This then needs to be imported into your pool. Yet again these options were made by NelVlesis.

So why the two options? Well the config option gives you more control and still allows for randomisation, whereas the pool option is so much easier to use.

[h1] Known Issues [/h1]
[b] Without being 'setup' this mod technically does nothing [/b]
The mod may cause a slight lag/delay when units are spawned in as it adjusts and loads the cosmetics.
